**Chapter 11**

I originally made figures 11.1 and 11.5 (in R) under contract to DataCamp. You can take part in [their project](https://www.datacamp.com/projects/496) to find out more about random forests and apply them to this dataset. Figures 11.2, 11.3, 11.4 and 11.6 were made in R and [the code is here](Ch11.R). Figures 11.7 and 11.8 were made by other people.

[Figure 11.2](11-iris1.svg) is a scatterplot with a third (outcome, dependent, target or endogenous variable, depending on your background) variable encoded as colour, then tree partition lines and labels added in Inkscape.

Figure 11.3 is similar but shows a regression tree, so the outcome variable is a continuous value and is encoded to marker size on the [left image](11-iris-3a.svg). In the [right image](11-iris-3b.svg), the residual (error) value is encoded to marker size instead. Here, the partition lines are added inside R.

A couple of sparklines turn up on the same page as Figure 11.3. The book was typeset in Latex, and there is a sparkline package which you can add, allowing you to draw these. This is what the actual Latex code for that paragraph looks like (the numbers are just made up to create a certain image):
```
Just as we could have \index{scatter plot}marginal densities on a scatter plot (Chapter 3), we could also add marginal plots of residuals versus predictor values (perhaps with a \index{smoothing}smooth regression line like LOESS through them). A random scatter \begin{sparkline}{13}
\sparkdot 0.50 0.79 blue
\spark 0.0 0.97 0.08 0.26 0.17 0.49 0.25 0.67 0.33 0.42 0.42 0.39 0.50 0.79 0.58 0.91 0.67 0.52 0.75 0.83 0.83 0.17 0.92 0.33 1.0 0.08 /
\end{sparkline} (with the blue dot at the location of the branch) would indicate that the tree found reasonable points at which to branch, while a change at the point of the branch \begin{sparkline}{13}
\sparkdot 0.50 0.56 blue
\spark 0.0 0.23 0.08 0.25 0.17 0.10 0.25 0.14 0.33 0.21 0.42 0.25 0.50 0.66 0.58 0.74 0.67 0.93 0.75 0.83 0.83 0.76 0.92 1.00 1.0 0.89 /
\end{sparkline} would suggest that maybe trees are not a good way to model these data.
```

Figure 11.4 was originally generated from the `tree` package in R, but required considerable tweaking in Inkscape afterwards to look at all good, so in my opinion it would be better to forget `tree` for this purpose and just draw it from scratch yourself.

[Figure 11.6](11-svm.svg) is a scatterplot where markers within a certain radius of the centre are coloured red (that red leaf from the park, in fact).
