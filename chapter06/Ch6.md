**Chapter 6**

Figures 6.1, 6.2, 6.5 and 6.7 made in R and [the code is here](Ch6.R). Figure 6.6 was made in Stata and [the code is here](Ch6.do). Figures 6.3 and 6.4 were made by other people.

[Figure 6.1](6-cancer-bars.svg) is simply a bar chart, and [Figure 6.2](6-cancer2.svg) is a scatterplot with lines added to make the lollipop look.

Figure 6.5 comprises semi-transparent scatterplots of random data with correlations of [0.2](6-correlation-2.svg), [0.6](6-correlation-6.svg) and [0.9](6-correlation-9.svg). [Figure 6.6](6-scatterplot-matrix.svg) does much the same thing but with the iris dataset, in a matrix layout. [Figure 6.7](6-heatmap-matrix.svg) is the same thing, but replaces the scatterplots with blocks of colour that show the statistic of correlation rather than the data.
