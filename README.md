Code and data for images in my book "Data Visualisation: charts, maps and interactive graphics"

This webpage accompanies my book [*Data Visualisation: charts, maps and interactive graphics]*(#), which is published by CRC Press and part of the CRC-ASA series on Statistical Reasoning In Science And Society.

Here, I explain how I made the images in the book, and some of the back story behind the examples made by others. Everything is arranged by chapter in the tabs below. There are links to code files for R and Stata, the data files, and the SVG originals. All the code files here are my own work and I release them under [The Unlicense](http://unlicense.org/).

Files are named after the chapter and figure numbers. Each chapter has a .md markdown file that you should read before diving into the .do and .R code. Many of the images are here in .svg format too. Where there is no .svg, this is explained in the .md file. Some images were created ex nihilo in the text editor, and almost all had manual tweaks to SVG in the editor or Inkscape. This is discussed in the .md files, but in many cases it is just to make text legible in book format, which is perhaps not necessary for your own work if you want to adapt what is here.

This book is aimed at:
* Anyone working with data, or considering a career working with data, who wants to expand their skills in visualisation
* The boss who has to hire, or commission, someone to make dataviz for his/her organisation, monitor their progress and be assured of good results
