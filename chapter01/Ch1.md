**Chapter 1**

Fig 1.1 was manually annotated onto a scatter plot of train delays (but not the same dataset that we use in the rest of the book) in Inkscape. I only saved the raster image, like an idiot (this is the only such instance in the whole book! always keep an SVG of everything!). Still, you can look at the unannotated version (generated from Stata) [here](#).

Fig 1.2 was a screenshot from [DrawMyData](http://www.robertgrantstats.co.uk/drawmydata.html), a little interactive webpage I made a while back, taken by Alberto Cairo after he drew the Datasaurus, and kindly shared with me. The Datasaurus became his most popular blog post ever and got incorporated into a lot of other people's work, a small minority of whom acknowledged poor old Alberto. The most ingenious of these was [Autodesk Research](https://www.autodeskresearch.com/publications/samestats), who got my methodviz of 2017 award for it.

Fig 1.3 was made in R with some pretty standard and ugly base code. See [Ch1.R](#).

Figs 1.6-1.9 were made, as you can see in the book, with paper, tracing paper, acetate transparency, coloured pencils, sticky tape and fine nib whiteboard marker pens. The map is by Google and the data are based on (but not accurate to) that from the book "Statistics: unlocking the power of data" by Lock, Lock, Lock, Lock and Lock. I recommend this book for beginners in statistics, by the way. You can also find the dataset on their website [StatKey](http://www.lock5stat.com/StatKey/index.html).

Fig 1.10 was made by creating the map in [Mapbox](https://mapbox.com), saving it as a raster, importing it into Inkscape so it became the background to an SVG file, and then adding the other stuff (rings, bars, text, dotted lines) on top. I got the basic layout right in Inkscape then added the bars, circles and lines in the text editor because it was easy to get everything lined up, and to keep the code simple.

Figs 1.4 & 1.5 were made by other people.
