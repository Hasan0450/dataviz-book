**Chapter 15**

Chris Whong's 2013 data are explained [here](https://chriswhong.com/open-data/foil_nyc_taxi/), and there are links to download them.

I made Figure 15.1 in Stata as part of [a talk](https://www.stata.com/meeting/uk16/slides/grant_uk16.pdf) at the London Users' Group meeting in 2016. An illustrative (non-C++) do-file is [here](NYC-taxis.do). This is the same dataset I sampled from for the DataCamp project mentioned in Chapter 11.

Figure 15.2 is by Oliver O'Brien and the original website is [here](http://bikes.oobrien.com/london/).
